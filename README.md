# Summary
RydShare is a smart application that helps people to share cars without sharing actual keys with each other. This key feature makes our application safe and convenient for use. We make use of the SmartCar API's to make this possible. Our app provides the features to book, unbook,lock, unlock and also know the exact location of the car.

### Notes
Although this is a Hackathon project, this isn't the final version. We plan to continue development and testing of this project to incorporate new features and release this project fully with install instructions.
