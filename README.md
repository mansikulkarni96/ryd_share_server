# Summary
Iterport is a smartcar application built with the purpose of providing on-demand access to drive as well as share cars conveniently and securely between car owners and car users. The users can look up the list of nearby cars, checkout the car details, pricing per miles, location of the vehicle and book the car through our website.  After booking the car, they can conveniently lock and unlock the car using our web app and also drop it off at the location after use.
